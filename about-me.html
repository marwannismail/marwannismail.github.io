        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Marwan Ismail and I am an aspiring full stack developer and software engineer.
            All of my life, I have been interested in mathematics, science and technology, so when I discovered that
            software engineering encompasses all of these fields, I was eager to pursue it as my career path. The frontend and
            backend aspects of programming fascinate and captivate me, hence my efforts to learn as much about each respectively, demonstrated
            in the creation of various games and this very website.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
        <p>I have experience with various industry-standard programming languages such as Python, C++, HTML and CSS.
            The majority of my knowledge is concentrated in these languages, and I have sought many opportunities to learn about each,
            from taking computer science courses at school to self education. A book I very much recommend is <strong>Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, Third Edition</strong>
            by Michael Dawson. He explains Python concepts and object-oriented programming through game development, making it both fun and informative.
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of projects I have created: </p>

        <p>I have also followed various tutorials to create the following games 
            <em>(Note: I do not own these projects. They are merely to demonstrate that I have knowledge of the 
            concepts involved. All credit goes to the original creators of the programs)</em>:</p>
