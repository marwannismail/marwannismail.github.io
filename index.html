        <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
        <!--<p class="information biography">Hello. My name is Marwan Ismail and I am an avid coder and aspiring full stack developer. 
            I have some experience with the Python, C++, HTML and CSS programming languages, but I am always open to learning more everyday. 
            All of my life, I have been interested in mathematics, science and technology, 
            and software development checks all of those boxes for an interesting, lengthy career.
            Much of my work has been focused on procedural and object-oriented programming, such as game development.</p>
        <h2>Where I am from</h2>
        <p class="information ethinicity">I am ethnically an Egyptian. 
            I speak the Egyptian dialect of Arabic and I am a Muslim. 
            I have visited Egypt many times, and have seen the famous Great Pyramids and explored the tombs of pharaohs.
            It was a fun experience.</p>

        <h2 id="interests">My Interests</h2>
        <p>I have quite a few interests, namely: 
            <ul>
                <li>Practicing Islam</li>
                <li>Software Development</li>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>Learning about the world</li>
                <li>Being around friends</li>
            </ul>
            I tend to be very social around those I am closest to.
        </p>
        <h2 id="edu-car">Eduation and Career Aspirations</h2>
        <div class="information career">
        <p>As mentioned before, I aspire to become a full stack developer, with skillsets for frontend and backend development. 
            I have a fascination with computers and technology, which led me to apply to universities for Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Computer Science.<br>

        <p>As shown, I applied to numerous Engineering and Computer Science programs at some of the top universities in Ontario.
             My goal is to be accepted into Waterloo's Software Engineering Program; however, if I receive offers from any of these universities, I would glaldy accept.
        </p>
        <p>You might be wondering why I mentioned the Double Degree program twice. 
            Well, since it is a joint program between two different universities, I applied to both universities for the program in order to increase my rate of acceptance. 
            The only difference, albeit major, is which school is considered the "home school". If I am accepted into the WLU side, my home school is WLU, and vice versa. 
            This matters for co-op placements, as UW's WaterlooWorks platform ensures that Waterloo students are able to get technical job offerings at Silicon Valley companies, where their Computer Science skills shine. 
            Meanwhile, for WLU, the BBA side of things comes into play more prominently with their co-op platform, Navigator.
