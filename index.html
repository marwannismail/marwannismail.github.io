        <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
        <p class="information biography">Hello. My name is Marwan Ismail and I am an avid coder and aspiring full stack developer. I have some experience with the Python, C++, HTML and CSS programming languages, but I am always open to learning more everyday. I was born in Manama, Bahrain, on January 7th, 2004, and I immigrated to Canada in 2006 along with my parents and younger brother. All of my life, I have been interested in mathematics, science and technology, and software development checks all of those boxes for an interesting, lengthy career.</p>
        <h2>Where I am from</h2>
        <p class="information ethinicity">I am ethnically an Egyptian. I speak the Egyptian dialect of Arabic and I am a Muslim. My parents were born and raised in Egypt, having moved to Bahrain when they got married. My father had already been working in Bahrain prior to their marriage, so it was the optimal place to live. My parents always wanted to leave Egypt in favor of a land of opportunity, which Egypt was not. Furthermore, my parents thought ahead to this very situation I am in, where I must go to university. Had we continued to live in Bahrain, my father would have wanted me to go to a Canadian university as an international student while the rest of the family lived in Bahrain. Besides, to my father, Bahrain was merely a pitstop before his real goal of bringing his family to Canada. Ironically, despite having lived and worked in America for three years of his life, he did not consider America a nice enough country to raise a family in. And so, we immigrated to Canada, and I have continued to call this land home up until the present.</p>

        <h2 id="interests">My Interests</h2>
        <p>I have quite a few interests, namely: 
            <ul>
                <li>Practicing Islam</li>
                <li>Software Development</li>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>Learning about the world</li>
                <li>Being around friends</li>
            </ul>
            I tend to be very social around those I am closest to.

        <h2 id="edu-car">Eduation and Career Aspirations</h2>
        <div class="information career">
        <p>As mentioned before, I aspire to become a full stack developer, with skillsets for frontend and backend development.

        <p>As shown, I applied to numerous Engineering and Computer Science programs at some of the top universities in Ontario. My goal is to be accepted into Waterloo's Software Engineering Program; however, if I receive offers from any of these universities, I would glaldy accept. Speaking of which, I received an offer from WLU for their Double Degree program.</p>
        <p>You might be wondering why I mentioned this program twice. Well, since it is a joint program between two different universities, I applied to both universities for the program in order to increase my rate of acceptance. The only difference, albeit major, is which school is considered the "home school". If I am accepted into the WLU side, my home school is WLU, and vice versa. This matters for co-op placements, as UW's WaterlooWorks platform ensures that Waterloo students are able to get technical job offerings at Silicon Valley companies, where their Computer Science skills shine. Meanwhile, for WLU, the BBA side of things comes into play more prominently with their co-op platform, Navigator.</p>
