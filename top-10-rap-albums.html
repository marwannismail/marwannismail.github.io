        <p><br>There are many contenders for the best rap album of all time. The 1990s especially
        were the Golden Age of Hip-Hop, where beats all had rich and different sounds to them, sampling was a common practice that brought variety to 
        the album. As such, many of the entries on this list will be from the 1990s and the 2000s. This is my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.
